# Clean Architecture

This is a study project to practice TDD and a good approach of Clean Architecture for flutter projects.
It is based on [Reso Coder](https://resocoder.com/category/tutorials/flutter/tdd-clean-architecture/) series. This is fully implemented with flutter 2.5.1 and dart 2.14.2. So it's a totally Null Safety version (to reach it, I had to change a few things from the original tutorial).

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
